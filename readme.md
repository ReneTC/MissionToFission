# Mission To Fission
This game/simulator started out as a simulation to explain fission on the YouTube channel Higgsino Physics. 

Feel free to clone this project, load width Godot and play for free. It will also be on steam later.

This game is currently under development.

## Contributing 
Feel free to submit code changes! I would love the help. Everyone who submits code will be included under the credits tab in the game. 
**!! Please notice !!** While the game is free and open source for everyone able to compile it, it's for sale on steam. The income is for further development of the game and new videos. 

You can also help by submitting bugs, or ideas on how to enhance the game. 

## Godot 
This game is made with Godot 4.3, and scripted width GDScript.
Probably it should have been made width C# for better performance. 

## Known Issues: 
- Only runs on 1920*1080 screen
- Game stops at 1000 neutrons

## Big Todo's:
- Add "options" settings, for sound music and such.
- make screen responsive.
- Optimize performance.


## Todo now
- fix settings physics chganges

## Small Todo's 
- Tween animations (such as color changes and deletions)

# Feedback:
- screen resolution for mac is off
- I think it would help to have more instructions on what's happening
during the Game Mode and more clear objectives. It's definitely fun playing
around with. But if you had certain objectives to obtain and certain levels to pass,
it would make it way cooler Idk what you have in mind, but one idea would be that
you need to produce a certain amount of energy to power something without destroying it.
I think you mentioned a kettle in the tutorial. So level 1 could be a kettle, level 2, a whole room,
level 3 an entire house, ... etc.
