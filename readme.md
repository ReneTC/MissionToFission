# Mission To Fission
This game/simulator started out as a simulation to explain fission on the YouTube channel Higgsino Physics. 

Feel free to clone this project, load width Godot and play for free. It will also be on steam later.

This game is currently under development.

## Contributing 
Feel free to submit code changes! I would love the help. Everyone who submits code will be included under the credits tab in the game. 
**!! Please notice !!** While the game is free and open source for everyone able to compile it, it's for sale on steam. The income is for further development of the game and new videos. 

You can also help by submitting bugs, or ideas on how to enhance the game. 

## Godot 
This game is made with Godot 4.4, and scripted width GDScript.

## Known Issues: 
- Only runs on 1920*1080 screen
- Game stops at 1000 neutrons

## Big Todo's:
- Add "options" settings, for sound music and such.
- make screen responsive.
- Optimize performance.
- Tween animations (such as color changes and deletions)
## Todo now
- Bug 1 - When played around in the different tutorials and sandboxes and I went back to the simplified reactor tutorial it used a fast neutron instead of a thermal neutron, which didn't progress the tutorial...  had to exit and go back into the game for it to work again as a thermal neutron.
- Bug 2 - When i tabbed out of the game after exiting a tutorial and tabbed back in i got the tutorial text on the homepage.
- bug 3 - you cant exit the game when prompted for reactor modification.
- Text bounces on control when you hover over the,
- change to percentages from decimals in all settings
- make physics changer hold most items, now it's duplciated


## Small Todo's 


## Unfixed feedback:
- The fission sound becomes quite distorted when 500+ neutrons are active. Maybe limit the gain or apply some audio 
  filtering when too many neutrons are present?
- The sound of the control rods loops in a relatively annoying way and continues even when the rods are fully inserted 
  or withdrawn.
