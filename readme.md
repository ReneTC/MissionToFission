# Mission To Fission
This game/simulator started out as a simulation to explain fission on the YouTube channel Higgsino Physics. 

Feel free to clone this project, load width Godot and play for free. It will also be on steam later, width the price of around 5 euro to support further development the game and support upcoming videos on Higgsino Physics.

This game is currently under development.

## Contributing 
Feel free to submit code changes! I would love the help. Everyone who submits code will be included under the credits tab in the game. **!! Please notice !!** While the game is free and open source for everyone able to compile it, it's for sale on steam. The income is for further development of the game or new videos. 

You can also help by submitting issues if you find bugs, or get ideas on how to enhance the game. 

## Godot 
This game is made with Godot 4.3, and scripted width GDScript. Probably it should have been made width C# for better performance. 

## Known Issues: 
- Only runs on 1920*1080 screen
- Will crash at around 2000 neutrons
- UI looks so bad
- No actual game so far, only simulation (no goal or story currently)

## Todo's:
- Make tutorial for game. Maybe a "map" that explains everything.
- Make much better UI. And haptics. 
- Add "options" settings.
- make screen responsive.
- Optimize performance.
- Make actual game with objective. Currently, there is no goal. Just a simulator.

## Small Todo's 
- Tween animations (such as color changes and deletions)
- fix issue with neutrons count not resetting when switching map
- fix end screen pop up 
- fix contribute link credits. and chance to about instead

## Higgsino notes. Ideas for game:
- modifiers:
	- Shorten control rods
	- make control rods move faster or slower 
	- higher enrichment / lower 
	- more uranium nuclei
- Notes
	- https://wenrexa.itch.io/nesia04 make ui like thus
