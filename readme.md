# Mission To Fission

Feel free to clone this project, load width Godot and play for free. It will also be on steam later, width the price of around 5 euro to support further development the game and support upcoming videos on Higgsino Physics.

This game is currently under development.

## Contributing 
Feel free to submit code changes! I would love the help. Everyone who submits code will be included under the credits tab in the game. **!! Please notice !!** While the game is free and open source for everyone able to compile it, it's for sale on steam. The income is for further development of the game or new videos. 

You can also help by submitting issues if you find bugs, or get ideas on how to enhance the game.
