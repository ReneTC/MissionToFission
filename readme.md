# Mission To Fission
This game/simulator started out as a simulation to explain fission on the YouTube channel Higgsino Physics. 

Feel free to clone this project, load width Godot and play for free. It will also be on steam later.

This game is currently under development.

## Contributing 
Feel free to submit code changes! I would love the help. Everyone who submits code will be included under the credits tab in the game. 
**!! Please notice !!** While the game is free and open source for everyone able to compile it, it's for sale on steam. The income is for further development of the game and new videos. 

You can also help by submitting bugs, or ideas on how to enhance the game. 

## Godot 
This game is made with Godot 4.3, and scripted width GDScript.
Probably it should have been made width C# for better performance.
