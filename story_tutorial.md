## Introduction Scene: The Research Facility
Ah, another aspiring genius. Fantastic. Tell me, do you know the first thing about nuclear physics, or are you here because you couldn’t figure out how to work a toaster? Well, welcome to Mission to Fission, where we split atoms for a living—and sometimes for sport. Don’t touch anything unless I say so, or you might evaporate half the lab. Let’s get started before I lose the will to teach.

### Stage 1: Neutron-Uranium Fission

"This is Uranium-235, the rock star of radioactive elements. It’s unstable, cranky, and dangerous—basically my spirit animal. Hit it with a neutron, and it splits into smaller nuclei, releasing energy and more neutrons. That’s fission, the phenomenon that powers everything from reactors to regrettable explosions.


"Boom! Beautiful, isn’t it? And by ‘beautiful,’ I mean terrifyingly powerful. Now YOU try it. Fire this neutron."


"Congratulations, you’ve just unleashed nuclear energy. If you’re feeling a warm glow, don’t worry—it’s either pride or radiation poisoning."

### Stage 2: Chain Reaction

"Now here’s where things get wild. Those neutrons we just made? They can hit more U-235 atoms and start a chain reaction. If managed properly, this produces controlled energy. If not, it produces a crater where your lab used to be.


"Your job is to keep the reaction going without it spiraling into a fireworks show. Balance is key—too slow, and nothing happens. Too fast, and you’ll be vaporized. Think of it like babysitting: you want chaos, but manageable chaos. Try it."


"Look at you! A true Oppenheimer. Let’s hope your legacy isn’t as complicated."

### Stage 3: Control Rods

Chain reactions are fun—until they aren’t. Left unchecked, neutrons will wreak havoc faster than a toddler with a hammer. That’s why we use control rods, which absorb neutrons and keep things civilized. That’s where control rods come in. They absorb neutrons, like a sponge soaks up water—or like I absorb other people’s incompetence."

"Place these rods to keep the reaction stable. Too many, and you’ll kill the reaction. Too few, and you’ll have a thermonuclear barbecue. Simple, right?"

Not great, not terrible. For once, I’m mildly impressed. Let’s see how long that lasts.
### Stage 4: Running a Simple Reactor

"Alright, hotshot. Time to run an oversimplfied basic reactor. Use U-235, control rods, and neutrons to generate steady power. It’s like juggling chainsaws—but one wrong move, and you don’t get a circus. You get a crater."


"Don’t let it overheat. Don’t let it fizzle out. Keep the reactor stable. If you see a strong flash of blue light, congratulations: you’re now part of the reactor core.


You managed to power a kettle without annihilating the lab. Mark the calendar—it’s a miracle. Let's make the reactor more realistic.

### Stage 5: Water as a Coolant and Neutron Absorber

"Fission creates heat—a LOT of it. If you don’t cool the reactor, it’ll turn into a very expensive lava lamp. That’s why we use water. It absorbs heat, carries it to turbines, and—bonus—can soak up neutrons. But don’t overdo it, or you’ll choke the reaction."

"See that steam? That’s your reactor saying, ‘Thanks for not letting me melt.’ Keep the balance, or we’re all going swimming in boiling water."

"Cool as ice. Or lukewarm, at least. Let’s move on."
### Stage 6: Moderators

"Next, we’ve got moderators. Neutrons, left to their own devices, zip around too fast to hit anything. That’s where moderators come in. They slow neutrons down so they’re more likely to hit U-235. Basically, they make neutrons less useless. If only I could do the same for you.


## Stage 7: Xenon-135 Poisoning

"Xenon-135, the reactor’s version of a hangover. It builds up during fission and eats neutrons, choking your chain reaction. If you don’t manage it, your reactor’s basically on strike."


"Burn it off by temporarily increasing the reaction rate—or wait for it to decay naturally.  Either way, it’s a constant pain in the isotopes. Handle it.
