# disable mouse click for neutron
Dr. Splitz: Ah, another aspiring genius. Fantastic. Tell me, do you know the first thing about nuclear physics, or are you here because you couldn’t figure out how to work a toaster?
Dr. Splitz:  Well, welcome to Mission to Fission, where we split atoms for a living—and sometimes for sport. Don’t touch anything unless I say so, or you might evaporate half the lab. 
Dr. Splitz: Let’s get started before I lose the will to teach.
# appear uranium235
Dr. Splitz: This is Uranium-235, the rock star of radioactive elements. It’s unstable, cranky, and dangerous—basically my spirit animal. Hit it with a neutron, and it splits into smaller nuclei, releasing energy and more neutrons. That’s fission, the phenomenon that powers everything from reactors to regrettable explosions.
