This is Uranium-235, the rock star of radioactive elements. It’s unstable, cranky, and dangerous—basically my spirit animal.
Let's hit it with a neutron, and it will split into smaller nuclei, releasing energy and more neutrons. That’s fission, the phenomenon that powers everything from reactors to extremely powerful and extremely regrettable explosions.

Boom! Beautiful, isn’t it? And by ‘beautiful,’ I mean terrifyingly powerful.
Now YOU try it. Fire some neutrons and make them split the Uranium.

Congratulations, you’ve just unleashed nuclear energy.
If you’re feeling a warm glow, don’t worry—it’s either pride or radiation poisoning.
