Alright,. Time to run an oversimplfied basic reactor. 
Let's add control rods. Your job is now to use U-235, control rods, and neutrons to generate steady power. 
[signal arg="add_control_rods"]
It’s like juggling chainsaws—but one wrong move, and you don’t get a circus. You get a crater.
Don’t let it overheat. Don’t let it fizzle out. Keep the reactor stable. 
If you see a strong flash of blue light, congratulations\: you’re now part of the reactor core.
You managed to power a kettle without annihilating the lab. Mark the calendar—it’s a miracle.
 That's the simplest form of a nuclear reactor, It's really oversimplified. Let's make it more realstic.
... We will do that next time ....
